Resume – How does the internt work? (full course free CodeCamp.org)


(0:00:00) Intro
The course introduces the goal: explaining how devices connect and communicate over the internet, step by step.

(0:01:55) What is a Switch and why do we need it?
A switch connects multiple devices in a local network (LAN). It forwards data to the correct device using MAC address, reducing collisions and improving efficiency compared to hub.

(0:13:16) What is a Router?
A router connects different networks together (LAN to WAN/Internet). It uses IP addresses to forward data packets to their destination, unlike switches that rely only on MAC addresses

(0:19:43) What does the internet represent?
The internet is a global network of networks. Each device doesn’t connect directly to every other device but instead communicates through interconnected routers.

Explains how routing tables and paths determine the journey of packets across multiple networks.

Discusses how data is broken into packets, transmitted, and then reassembled at the destination, ensuring reliability and efficiency.

(0:55:10) Wide Area Network (WAN)
WANs are larger networks that connect multiple LANs across cities, countries, or globally. The internet itself is the biggest WAN.

Goes deeper into how routers choose the best path, use NAT (Network Address Translation), and manage data between private and public networks.

(1:17:26) Internet Service Provider (ISP) (Part-1)
Explains the role of ISPs as gateways to the Internet. They provide IP addresses and maintain the infrastructure that connects households and businesses to the global network.

Details how ISPs interconnect, form peering agreements, and manage traffic between different networks to ensure global connectivity.
