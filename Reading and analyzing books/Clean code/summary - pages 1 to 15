Clean Code
Good code is easy to read, understand, and maintain.
It should be simple, direct, and clear, almost like well-written prose.


The Code
All software is made of code, no matter the frameworks, languages, or tools.
Code is the foundation of everything, and there is no escaping it.


Bad Code
Appears when developers prioritize speed, negligence, or poorly thought-out solutions.
“Dirty code” may work in the short term but causes huge problems later.


The Cost of Confusing Code
Bad code increases maintenance and development time.
Teams spend more time understanding old code than building new features.
This leads to delays, frustration, and wasted resources.


The Big Redesign in the Sky
Man companies end up discarding old systems and rewriting them from scratch due to poor quality.
This is costly and often ineffective, as the cycle repeats if discipline is missing.


Attitude
Programmers must take responsibility for the code they write.
It is the developer’s duty to fight for quality, even under external pressure (deadlines, managers, clients).


The Grand Dilemma
The tension between fast delivery and quality.
However, bad code doesn’t make things faster—it slows projects down in the medium and long term.


The Art of Clean Code
Writing clean code is more than technique: it requires discipline, practice, and even aesthetic sense.
Good programmers treat code as craftsmen treat their work.


What is Clean Code?
Clear, efficient, direct, readable, and easy to maintain.
It hides nothing, avoids duplication, and follows best practices.


Schools of Thought
There are different perspectives on what defines “clean code,” but the essence is the same: clarity and simplicity.
The author shares insights from renowned programmers to enrich the concept.


We Are Authors
Programming is like writing.
Code should be written with the reader in mind (other developers, or even your future self).


The Boy Scout Rule
“Leave the code cleaner than you found it.”
Small, constant improvements prevent the system from rotting over time.


Prequel and Principles
Before diving into techniques, one must understand the core principles:
Simplicity, clarity, responsibility, and discipline.
These fundamentals prepare the ground for the practices explained later in the book.
